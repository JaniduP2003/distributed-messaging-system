01. Run the server.py file
02. in new terminals, run the backup server
            python server.py --host localhost --port 5001
            python server.py --host localhost --port 5002
03. run client instances in seperate terminals

when running, terminal path should be in src folder

IT23184558 - D B Y BINUWARA - Fault tolerance

                  Class: Failover
                  Detects failed nodes using TCP checks (_is_node_alive and _check_node_health)
                  Handles automatic failover and maintains a list of healthy nodes.

                  Class: ClusterServer
                  Integrates Failover and starts/stops it with the server.
                  Handles client reconnections after failover.

                  Class: MessageClient
                  Implements reconnection logic to switch to another server if the current one fails (reconnect, connect).

IT23294998 - PABASARA T D J - Time Synchronization
                  Class: TimeSync
                  Synchronizes server time using NTP servers.
                  Provides synchronized timestamps for message events.
                  Both servers use TimeSync to timestamp messages and events.

IT23398184 - DINUJAYA K V T - Data Replication & Consistency
                  File: message_storage/storage.py
                  Class: MessageStorage
                  Uses raftos.ReplicatedDict and ReplicatedList for distributed, replicated storage.
                  Ensures strong consistency and deduplication (unique message IDs).
                  Provides APIs for storing, retrieving, and deleting messages.
                  Both servers instantiate and use MessageStorage for all message operations.

IT23424432 - ABEYRATHNA J G D A - Consensus Implementation
                  File: consensus/consensus.py (imported in paste-2.txt)
                  Class: Consensus
                  Manages Raft consensus, leader election, and monitors leadership status.
                  Ensures all nodes agree on the state and message order.
                  
                  Class: ClusterServer
                  Integrates and starts the Consensus component.
                  Configures and registers nodes with Raft (raftos).
